In this project, you are given a “broken” Windows 10 PC and asked to figure out what’s wrong with it and then make changes to fix and secure it. The process of analyzing and applying security happens in workplaces around the globe and is exactly what cybersecurity professionals do daily. This project gives you the opportunity to apply what you’ve learned in the course by investigating a Windows 10 PC, securing it, and then explaining what you found and did in your security report. The same skills you use on one PC can be applied to thousands.
